# 1) Big Mart Sales - 
My take on Analytics Vidhya BigMart’s sale(https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/) 
prediction hackathon.
We have  to identify the most important variables and to define the best regression model for predicting 
out response variable.
Hence, this analysis will be divided into five stages:

The Algorithms aren't covered in an extensive way as it assumes the user to know the maths behind them.
Please visit the Big Mart Sales Sales folder for the self explanatory code and the dataset used

# 2) Customer Segmentation-
  My take on understanding Unsupervised ML and specifically introduction and implementation of clustering algorithms
  
  # We will dwell in to the unsupervised aspect of machine learning in this section


   
  Unsupervised learning is the training of an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm using information that is neither classified     nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance



  # Pretty interesting right????

  Please go to the Customer Segementation folder for the code written in jupyter notebook and the dataset used for the same.

# 3) Market Mix Modelling-
  My take on market mix modelling concepts and modelling techniques
  
  # We will dwell in to  how four P's vary with each other, explain the model together and how can they solve problems for the organizations

  Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is one of the most popular analysis under Marketing Analytics which helps organisations in estimating the   effects of spent on different advertising channels (TV, Radio, Print, Online Ads etc) as well as other factors (price, competition,     weather, inflation, unemployment) on sales. In simple words, it helps companies in optimizing their marketing investments which they     spent in different marketing mediums (both online and offline).

 # 4) Human Activity Recognition (Unsupervised) -
   A classic dataset to work on the unsupervised techniques
    
   With the advancement in IOT, sensors analytics have played a huge role in day-to-day activities. Sudden spike in the availability and usage of smart watches is a great    example for this. Application of sensors analytics living beings to track their actions and vital signs has huge set of problem pool, namely – Calorie tracker, early warning for life threatening diseases, protection of endangered species, improve sports person’s abilities etc. The current problem can be considered as the base for all the above mentions applications of sensor analytics on living things. Certain experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz were captured.
    
   We will touch base on few concepts of k- means and feature transformation

 # Many Many more to be added to the list. May the data be with you.
